# Whale Portfolio Analysis

### Returns
From the plot of the cumulative returns, it appears that there are only two portfolios that outperformed the S&P 500 -- Algo 1 and Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. Algo 1 far outperformed the other portfolios, and Berkshire Hathaway came out slightly ahead of the S&P 500. Though Algo 2 and Soros Fund Management did worse than the S&P 500, they still managed to turn a profit. Tiger Global Management LLC and Paulson & Co, Inc. performed the worst, with cumulative returns coming in lower than the initial investments.

### Risks

Moving onto the box plots, we are able to discern the spread of the returns for the various portfolios. We see that Tiger Global had the largest spread by far and that Paulson & Co, Inc was the smallest spread, followed closely by Algo 2. However, it is important to note that the Berkshire Hathaway's spread within one standard deviation of its mean was the largest (as shown by the largest "box"), indicating that their stocks overall likely had a larger spread -- compared to Tiger Global which had large spreads among the outliers, but tighter spread within one standard deviation of its mean.

When comparing standard deviations for each portfolio, we see that both Tiger Global and Berkshire Hathaway's portfolios come in as riskier than the S&P 500 -- this is likely due to the factors mentioned above -- a larger overall spread in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and high ranges between outliers for Tiger Global's portfolio.
