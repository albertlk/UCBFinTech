## Overview and Origin

Square was founded in 2009 by Twiter co-founder Jack Dorsey and Jim McKelvey [1]. According to a 2010 article by Fast Company, the origins of Square came from James McKelvey's crafting business [2]. He would frequently have people who would love to buy a piece of work; however, because he was not able to accept cards as payment, his customers would not be able to make payment and the sale would be lost. When this was shared with his friend Jack Dorsey, the two of them set about to create a solution that would make card acceptance easy for small businesses like that of McKelvey.

From there, the business grew through eight rounds of funding, raising $590.5M [3]. Square then went on to IPO in November of 2015. Since then, especially with the developements of the global pandemic, Square's market cap is sitting above $64B. Along with this growth, Square's portfolio of products and services for its merchant acquiring and payment terminals grown to include e-commerce, marketing, business analytics, and payroll tools -- this part of their business is categorized as their "Seller Ecosystem" segment in their financial filings [4]. Not only that, it has also expanded into the consumer market with its Cash App, allowing for P2P payments, direct deposits, and investing [5]. For the purposes of this case study, I will be focusing on the core value proposition that launched Square into the spotlight -- the Seller Ecosystem, most prominently, its merchant acquiring and payment terminals business.

## Business Activities

At its outset, the primarily objective was simple -- how could small to medium-sized business accept payment cards without the often expensive and complex processes of engaging with various payment terminals providers, payment processors, and merchant acquirers. Thus, Square's initial goal was to fill in this gap by simplifying the process and make transparent the costs and fees of card acceptance.
